saw this: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/wasm-threads

installed emcc with this: https://github.com/juj/emsdk

calling js with this: https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html#implement-c-in-javascript

Not sure how to pass a string buffer to a javascript function.
Need to read further on that. Is that even possible?
